## CryptoBrite 

#### CryptoBrite is a cross platform app written in React Native for SFHacks 2018. It allows users to buy tickets to events with the crypto currency Dash.  

##Mission Statement  
#### What if you could browse event, like a party, and purchase spots through cryptocurrency with the ease of your smartphone? No more forgetting tickets or losing tickets and worrying about getting into your next new hot event. Our team has two applications written for both android and iOS mobile application called CryptoBrite. Dual platform and functionality is done through writing the applications in React Native. The first application displays different events like, concerts, that can be purchased through cryptocurrency with the help of coin payments api. Once purchased through coin payments you are then given a QR code as your ticket which can be scanned by our second application to validate the QR code ticket. Our first application would be helpful for people to easily purchase tickets to an event with the connivence of their smartphone and our second application would be helpful for the event organizers.
